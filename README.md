The library of technological research and learning by [Professor Ragna](https://twitter.com/professorragna).

## What is in this repo?
A lot of the material that will be in this repo will be technical, and perhaps even behavioral. Ultimately, I am utilizing this repo as a library to grow myself as an engineer and a person. But not only that, I aim for this library to also be of high value to any other engineer, start-up enthusiast, and even recruiters that stumbles upon this repo.

The `ragna-brain` library will demonstrate important and relevant topics within the start-up and technical space that I have researched, experienced, and learned about during my career as an engineer and start-up builder. I begin building this library as a Senior Software Engineer with a wide array of experience across the full-stack, and will continue building this library as I grow into roles such as a Staff Software Engineer, Director of Engineering, CTO, CEO, and eventually an Angel Investor.

## Upcoming Material
- AI & Machine Learning
- API Development & Best Practices
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Personal System Design of Discord
- Personal System Design of AngelList
- Product Philosophies
- Start-up Philosophies
- etc.
