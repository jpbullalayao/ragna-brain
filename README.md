The library of technological research and learning by [Professor Ragna](https://twitter.com/professorragna).

## What is in this repo?
The material that you will discover in this repo will be technical, and perhaps even behavioral. Ultimately, I am building this repo to serve as a library to grow myself as an engineer and a person. But not only that, I aim for this library to also be of high value to other engineers, start-up enthusiasts, and even recruiters that want to learn new ideas in technology and start-ups.

The `ragna-brain` library will demonstrate important and relevant topics within the start-up and technical space that I have researched and learned about during my career as an engineer and start-up builder. In addition to that, I will also share personal anecdotes based on experience and theory. I begin building this library as a Senior Software Engineer with a wide array of experience across the full-stack, and will continue building this library as I grow into roles such as a Staff Software Engineer, Director of Engineering, CTO, CEO, and eventually an Angel Investor.
